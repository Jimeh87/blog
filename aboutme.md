title: About me
---

My name is Jim Rennie. I'm a full stack software developer who believes in writing clean, readable, and well tested code. I am a life learner who enjoys working with the newest technologies, but also appreciates working with older more mature technologies.

I have been interested in programming since I was 12 when a friend showed me how to make a simple html webpage. From there my interest grew and I built my first website with pleasant MIDI background music and more gifs than actual content. I've come a long way since then, but my enjoyment of programming remains.

My current interests include micro-services, responsive mobile apps, GraphQL, Spring Boot, and Angular. I always have a few learning projects on the go, that I hope to finish but never do.
